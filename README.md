# buoy-data-notebooks
I am interested in learning more about using python with data.  I am also a long time fan of buoy data.  For this reason I have been writing some Jupyter notebooks involving buoy data.  My hope is that this repository might be useful to others who are interested in these  things.  

In developing these Jupyter notebooks I spent a great deal of time learning how to get the buoy data from the National Buoy Data Center (NDBC) and then clean it.  I used the pandas library for both of these things.  I also attempt to follow the advise in [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) Hadley Wickham.  Finaly the github repository [buoypy](https://github.com/NickC1/buoypy) by Nick Cortale was very helpful for learning how to call `pd.readcvs()` properly.

I am presenting different parts of these Jupyter notebooks in my wordpress blog (https://dahelliwell.wordpress.com/).  If you find this repository helpful or if you see some areas that could use improvement please leave me a comment on my blog I would really appreciate the feedback.
